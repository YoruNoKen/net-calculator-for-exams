# net-calculator-for-exams

This is a net calculator for exams for Turkish students (idk if this applies to other countries as well but you're free to try)

### How to use 

Simply run `calculator.exe`.

After that, you input how many points are to be deducted from your net result if you get a question wrong. Then you input the total number of questions, correct answers, incorrect answers, and unanswered questions.

After you have entered all the values, the program will give you your results.
